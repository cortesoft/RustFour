# RustFour
Connect Four in Rust

To run:

* [Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
* Run `cargo build --release`
* Run `target/release/connect_four`

If you choose a Robot as a player, you will be asked how deep to look. This is how many turns it will look ahead for to choose its move. Anything bigger than 6 or 7 will start to be slow.
